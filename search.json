Currently, the Growth Scorecards include only data from IDEA’s Texas regions.\nAlthough our goal is to establish a single source of relevant data, such as school performance, enrollment, and financial characteristics, not all desired data can easily be pulled and cleaned within R without reaching out to partners within IDEA.\nThe purpose of this resource is to document where each metric comes from, how it is defined, and how to reproduce calculations for future iterations.",

    "text": "1.2 Accountability Ratings\nTexas Education Agency (TEA) uses the an accountability rating system to evaluate the academic performance of all Texas public districts, including public school districts and open-enrollment charter schools (Texas Education Agency 2025b). Annual ratings are based on three domains:\n\nStudent Achievement (STAAR, EOC, College, Career, and Military Readiness, graduation rates)\nSchool Progress (student academic growth, achievement relative to schools with similar economic disadvantage levels)\nClosing the Gaps (progress among students from specific groups, e.g. racial/ethnic groups, special education, Emergent Bilingual or English learner, etc.)\n\nEach district and campus receives an A-F letter grade for each of the three domains and one overall score with associated letter grade. For more information on how specific ratings are calculated by TEA, find the most recent Accountability Rating System manual (Texas Education Agency 2025b).\n\n1.2.1 Percentage of Schools Rated A & B and D & F\nFor the percentage of schools with specific letter grade accountability ratings, each individual school (Academy, College Prep) has its own rating. The metrics are calculated at the entity and region level as follows: \\[{\\% \\text{ of Schools Rated A or B}} = \\frac{(\\# \\text{ of Schools Rated A}) + (\\# \\text{ of Schools Rated B})}{\\text{Total } \\# \\text{ of Schools with Rating in Region}}*100\\] \\[{\\% \\text{ of Schools Rated D or F}} = \\frac{(\\# \\text{ of Schools Rated D}) + (\\# \\text{ of Schools Rated F})}{\\text{Total } \\# \\text{ of Schools with Rating in Region}}*100\\]\n\n\n1.2.2 Multi-Year Failure\nFor the multi-year failure metric, we considered schools with an overall rating &lt;70 to be “failing” and any schools with a failing rating for two subsequent rated years to have experienced a multi-year failure. To be counted as being in multi-year failure for the 2024-2025 school year, a school must have an overall rating score of &lt;70 in the 2024-2025 school year and the 2023-2024 school year.\nWe calculated the number and percentage of schools in each region multi-year filaure for the 2024-2025 year.\n\\[{\\% \\text{ of Schools with Multi-Year Failure}} = \\frac{\\# \\text{ of Schools with Multi-Year Failure}}{\\text{Total } \\# \\text{ of Schools with Rating in Region}}*100\\]\nIndividual schools are marked has having a previous had multi-year failure if the school had a rating &lt;70 for any two or more subsequently rated years prior to 2024-2025.\n\n1.2.2.1 Notes & Exclusions\n\nNo schools received ratings for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 school years, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This metric considers a school to have a multi-year failure if they were below the threshold in 2018-2019 and 2021-2022, because they were below the threshold for two subsequently rated years.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Source\nFor the each of the school years, accountability ratings were downloaded from the TEA Accountability Ratings page, by selecting the appropriate year and navigating to the relevant Data Download page.\nAlthough the download page structure differs some by year, in each case parameters were set to campus-level report, selecting the accountability summary (Texas Education Agency 2018, 2019, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025a), as seen in the screenshots below.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of download parameters for 2022-2023 accountability ratings\n\n\nFor 2022-2023 through 2024-2025, we requested the Accountability Rating and Overall Score data elements, but such download options were not available for the earlier years.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of download parameters for 2017-2018 accountability ratings.\n\n\nAlthough the script to call each year varies slightly, each includes a filter to maintain all IDEA TX schools, include any ratings of IDEA Travis schools that are a partnership with Midland ISD. At this time, IDEA Travis schools are considered one school, as “IDEA Travis Academy,” by TEA. If in the future, IDEA Travis schools are separated with TEA records, the filter shown below should hopefully help to retrieve any IDEA Travis schools when applied to the appropriate year.\n\nratings_25  &lt;- read.csv(\n  \"filepath/2025_Campus_Accountability_Summary.csv\", \n    header = TRUE, \n    as.is = c(\"CAMPUS\", \"DISTRICT\", \"COUNTY\", \"REGION\"),\n    colClasses = \"character\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter( # Keeps IDEA TX and the Travis Midland schools\n    DISTRICT == \"108807\" | \n    CAMPUS == \"165901139\" | \n    CAMPUS == \"165901138\" | \n    CAMPUS == \"165901137\" ) %&gt;% \n  select(CAMPUS, CAMPNAME, DISTRICT, CDALLS) %&gt;%\n  rename(\n    Rating_2024_2025 = CDALLS,\n    CAMPNAME25 = CAMPNAME) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Rating_2024_2025 = as.numeric(Rating_2024_2025))\n\n\n\n\n\nIDEA Public Schools Data Warehouse. 2025. “STAAR Assessment Data.”\n\n\nIDEA RAP Team. n.d.

Our desire is to have some measure of how many teaching positions were filled versus vacant at the beginning of the employment or school year, to assess difficulties in staffing teaching positions.\nIn Fall 2025, we relied on values provided in a slide deck report created by Limla Paul. The metric used was labeled as “% of Staffed Teachers & Co-Teachers as of 9/24/25” with the date the percentage refering to the first day of instruction within each region. She states that the values were computed as:\n\\[\n\\% \\text{ Staffed} = \\frac{\\text{Headcount} + \\text{Filled Vacancies}}{\\text{Headcount} + \\text{Filled Vacancies} + \\text{Remaining Vacancies}}*100\n\\]\nShe also stated that in the future, Chris Thompson recommends instead using the calculation that is currently used in the staffing dashboard that Limla manages:\n\\[\n\\% \\text{ Staffed} = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\# \\text{ of Remaining Vacancies}}{\\text{Active Count} + \\# \\text{ of Remaining Vacancies}}\\right)*100\n\\]\nWhere Remaining Vacancies refers to the remaining positions with open requisitions, and Active Count refers to current active staff who have begun work.

    "text": "4.2 Year Over Year (YOY) Teacher Retention\nYear Over Year (YOY) teacher retention is intended to represent the percentage of teaching staff hired in one school year that returned to a teaching position at IDEA Public Schools for the next school year. Each year, IDEA’s Human Assets team develops a comprehensive specifications for calculating staff retention, as detailed in their Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), stored on here on The Hub.\nTo my understanding (Hilary Doe), most of these specifications are carried out when labeling each individual as a Leaver or not prior to the data being pushed to the Data Warehouse. For example, individuals who do not return because they retire are not counted as Leavers according to the SOP (IDEA Public Schools 2024). Individuals with an Exit Reason of “Voluntary Retirement” are not listed as Leavers within the reporting.employees data. A full list of specifications, copied from the 2024-2025 Staff Retention SOP are listed in Section 4.2.2.\n\n4.2.1 Source\nThe YOY teacher retention data come from the reporting.employees table in the data warehouse(IDEA Public Schools 2024) and are limited to staff in teaching positions (filter(ISTEACHER == \"1\")}).\n\nreporting.employees &lt;- get_table(.table_name = \"Employees\",\n                                 .database_name = \"Staffing\",\n                                 .schema = \"Reporting\", \n                                 .server_name = \"RGVPDSD-DWPRD1\") %&gt;% \n  collect()\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Notes & Exclusions\nThe following details are taken directly from the 2024-2025 Staff Retention Standard Operating Procedures (IDEA Public Schools 2024), however it is important to note that each year’s SOP can be differ slightly, including the length of the staff retention year. For example, the 2023-2024 Staff Retention Year is defined as 7/1/2023 – 6/30/2024, whereas the 2024-2025 staff retention year is defined as 07/1/2024 – 08/14/2025 (IDEA Public Schools 2023, 2024).\n\nStaff Retention Definitions\n\nThe formula for calculating retention is as follows: \\[\\text{Retained} = \\frac{1-\\text{Leavers}}{\\text{Headcount}}*100\\]\nThe 2024-25 Staff Retention Year is defined as 07/1/2024 – 08/14/2025 (specific employee categories may have a different start to their Staff Retention Year based on their work calendar, but will not be earlier than 07/01/2024 – details below).\n“Headcount” is defined as the sum of all full-time, permanent employees who worked at IDEA Public Schools between 07/1/2024 and 08/14/2025. Examples of staff job groups that fall into this category are Administrative Professionals, Campus Administrative Professionals, Clerical Technical, Instructional Support, Teachers, and Manual Trades.\n\nRetention includes any staff member who is classified as full-time, permanent staff, including partial FTE staff. Descriptions of the employee classifications can be found in the Employee Handbook.\nChiefs are included in Executive Office retention, not the retention for their individual areas.\nPrincipals-in-Residence count toward the retention of the school they are assigned to for their residency.\nFounding Teacher Fellows count toward the retention of the school at which they are assigned for their fellowship.\nAll non-year-round staff who leave prior to the first day of their work calendar for the current staff retention year will be coded with an exit date prior to 08/15/2025 to ensure they do not count toward following staff retention year.\nExclusions: Employees classified as anything other than full-time, permanent employees are excluded from Headcount and Leavers. This includes, but is not limited to, the following titles:\n\nEnrichment Instructor, Enrichment Specialist, 21st Century Enrichment Specialist\nIntern, including Summer Interns and Year-round Interns\nAfter School Care\nParent Liaison\nMonitor, including Bus Monitor, Flex Monitor, Lunch Monitor, Recess Monitor, and School Monitor\nCamp Rio Program Staff & Camp Counselor\nFSS Substitute\nTutor\nAthletic Coach\nIDEA Substitute Teacher\n\n“Leaver” is defined as the sum of all full-time, permanent employees who have an effective exit date between 07/1/2024 and 08/14/2025.\n\nFull-time, permanent employees who transition into non-full-time permanent roles during the current Retention Year will count as leavers.\nFull-time, permanent employees who retire will count as leavers.\nThe last full-time role an employee holds is the position held accountable for retention. If an employee changes during the year from full time role A to full time role B then leaves the organization, they will be counted as a leaver for role B.\n\nExample: An API transitions to teacher in October and decides to leave at the end of the year. They will be counted as a teacher leaver\n\nThe last location an employee is based at and held a full-time role that they reported to is held accountable for retention of that employee. If an employee changes during the year from location A to location B, then leaves the organization, they will be counted as a leaver for location B as long as they reported to work at Location B.\n\nExample: A teacher transfers from IDEA Pharr to IDEA Rise in December and then leaves at the end of the year. They will be counted as a teacher leaver for IDEA Rise.\n\nEmployees moving from a permanent, full-time position to another permanent, full-time position are not considered leavers.\nFull-time employees in a permanent in the current retention year who transition to a non-full-time permanent role during the same retention year will count as a leaver.\nPermanent, full-time and permanent, part-time employees who leave IDEA Public Schools and return to IDEA Public Schools in a permanent, full-time or permanent, part-time capacity during the same retention year will not count as leavers.\nEmployees leaving and returning to the organization in a retention-eligible role with a start date in the same school year (re-hire) do not count as leavers. Those employees who return to work after the start of the next retention year will count as leavers.\nPositions that are eliminated due to budget constraints and/or grant-funded positions that are terminated because the grant concluded and was not continued will not count as leavers.\nEmployees who are reassigned but decline the reassignment and leave the organization will count as leavers attributed to the manager/campus for which they were employed on their last day of employment.\nPositions that are eliminated for other reasons will count as leavers.\nEmployees coded with the following termination codes will not be counted as leavers:\n\nIN04 - Death, IN05 - Ineligible For Hire, IN08 - Failed I-9 Verification, OT01 - Entity Change, OT02 - Employee did Not Start.\nOT02 – Employee did Not Start will only apply to new hires who did not begin a position at IDEA, not transfers. o Staff in National roles will not be counted in regional staff retention. They will only count as headcount and leavers for their Chief Area team.\n\nStaff members eligible to retire through their state employee retirement program and submit required paperwork within the staff retention year deadlines will not count as leavers once their official retirement is verified. o Leavers during the current staff retention year who are not exited before retention results for the current staff retention year are finalized, will count as leavers for the following staff retention year.\nLeaver role, status, or location changes not entered within the current staff retention year that are not entered before retention results for current staff retention year are finalized will not be captured in the final staff retention report of the current staff retention year.\n\n\n“School” is defined as either Academy or College Prep, typically the unit led by a principal.\n“Campus” is defined as Academy + College Prep; typically, both schools at one location.\nThe final retention metric will be rounded to the nearest whole number based on the tenths digit. (If .xx is ≥ .50, then it will round up. If .xx is &lt;.50, then it will round down.) For example:\n\n84.50% will round to 85%\n84.49% will round down to 84%\n\nStaff who are shared between Academy and College Prep will count 50% toward Academy, and 50% toward College Prep head count and leaver count. This includes all shared staff including, but not limited to, instructional staff, operations staff, and any school support staff. This ensures that shared staff, including operations, impact school retention. The formula is as follows: \\[\\text{School Retention} = 1-\\frac{\\text{School Leavers} + 0.5(\\text{Shared Staff Leavers})}{\\text{School Headcount} + 0.5(\\text{Shared Staff Headcount})} \\]\n\nAll IDEA Public Schools Teacher Retention\n\n“Headcount” is defined as the sum of all full-time, permanent employees in the Teacher Job Group who work at IDEA Public Schools between the start of their 2024-25 Work Calendar and 08/14/2025.\n\nInstructional staff (teachers and co-teachers/instructional support) and campus administrative professionals will count toward the school at which they work, not the campus.\nCampus support staff (i.e. administrative assistants, testing coordinators, 21st century site coordinators) will count toward campus and school retention if they are shared and toward school retention if they are not shared.\n\n“Leaver” is defined as the sum of all full-time, permanent Teachers who have an effective exit date between the first day of their 24-25 School Year work calendar (even if they participate in summer school or summer professional development) and 08/14/2025.\n\nAll teachers who leave prior 08/15/2025 will be coded with an exit date prior to 08/15/2025 to ensure they do not count toward 2025-2026 retention.\n\nCo-teachers and Founding Teacher Fellows do not count toward Teacher retention, to better align with PEIMS Teacher reporting, but do count toward All Staff retention. These roles will be included in the school All Staff retention but not in the school Teacher retention.\n\n\nThe teacher retention year begins on the first day of their work calendar, not the first day of summer PD. If a returning teacher no-shows for the first days of all-staff BOY PD, even if s/he were part of summer PD, s/eh will be counted as a leaver for the previous school year.\n\nIf a New Hire is a no-show on the first day of their work calendar, they should be coded as OT02 – Employee did not start, which will exclude them from the count.o If an employee shows up for the first day of their work calendar and subsequently leaves, they will count toward retention that year.\nFlex Teachers and Flex Co-Teachers count toward the retention for the Region in which they were hired, unless they have officially transitioned to a permanent campus-based teaching role.\n\nFlex Teachers and Flex Co-Teachers will not count toward the retention for the home campus at which they are based before they are assigned to a permanent campus-based role.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIDEA Public Schools. 2023. “2023-2024 Staff Retention Calculation Standard Operating Procedure.” https://ideapublicschoolsorg.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/HumanAssets/Shared%20Documents/2023-24%20Staff%20Retention%20SOP_FINAL_08.12.24.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=Xkh56Z.\n\n\n———. 2024. “2024-2025 Staff Retention Calculation Standard Operating Procedure.” https://ideapublicschoolsorg.sharepoint.com/HumanAssets/SiteAssets/SitePages/Retention-Policy/24-25-TX_Staff-Retention-SOP_Final_09032024.pdf?web=1.",

    "text": "6.1 Percentage Meeting Enrollment Goal\nBefore explaining each of the metrics and their sources in detail, it is important to note that although two of the metrics within Enrollment Readiness / Student Demand may sound similar, they are actually quite different. Although enrollment goals may be similar to capacity at some schools and campuses, in many cases they differ in meaningful ways.\nEnrollment targets vary by grade level and location, and are specific to an individual campus and context. Capacity, however, is based on a consistent estimate based on the current grade levels offered within a school. It is meant to measure how many students a school is currently educating versus how much they could this year. Enrollment goals may be well below the capacity for a given school or campus.\nEach year, each IDEA school has an assigned enrollment target or goal for each grade level they enroll, set by the Enrollment and School Launch Team. [Add information about who sets these and how].\nFor this metric, a single unit (grade level, school, campus, or region) is considered to have met its enrollment goal if the total number of students enrolled on the First Day Of Persistence (FDOP) is at or above the total enrollment goal for that unit.\nIf one school is under-enrolled but another is over-enrolled, a full campus may still meet its overall enrollment goal. For example, at FDOP 2025, enrollment at Austin Health Professions Academy was 13 students below its target (not meeting enrollment goal), but Austin Health Professions College Prep was 46 above its target (meeting enrollment goal). Therefore, the full Austin Health Professions campus was 33 students above its target and considered to be meeting its enrollment goal.\nThe percentage meeting enrollment goal within a unit is based on the number of sub-units, rather than the total number of students and enrollment target. For example, percentage of schools within a region meeting enrollment goal is calculated as:\n\\[{\\% \\text{ Schools Meeting Enrollment Goal}} = \\frac{\\# \\text{ of Schools Meeting Enrollment Goal}}{\\text{Total } \\# \\text{ of Schools within Region}}*100\\]\nWhereas the percentage of campuses within a region meeting enrollment goal is calculated as:\n\\[{\\% \\text{ Campuses Meeting Enrollment Goal}} = \\frac{\\# \\text{ of Campuses Meeting Enrollment Goal}}{\\text{Total } \\# \\text{ of Campuses within Region}}*100\\]",

Therefore, I built a few steps into the code that greatly increases the code length, but greatly decreases the time it takes to pull the data for us.\nFirst, we pull only a few variables from the enrollment details table for the academic years of interest to help us determine the appropriate First Day of Persistence (FDOP) for each school. FDOP is the 11th day of school, which typically14 calendar days after the First Day of School (FDOS).

    "text": "6.3 Student Annual Persistence\nAccording to the RAP Manual (IDEA RAP Team, n.d.),\n\nStudent Persistence is one of the most important measures that Chiefs, VPs, and School Leaders are always monitoring to understand our efforts in providing high quality services to our students and families. In order for a student to actualize the benefits of IDEA, the student must persist through high school. We say a student persisted if the student was enrolled and attended school for the entire academic school year, returned the following school year, and was enrolled and attending on [the “First Day of Persistence”]. In other words, the student was enrolled and attended school on the “First Day of Persistence” (FDOP) for two consecutive years. The only exception to this are New Students that enroll after the FDOP, attend the entire year, return the following year, and are enrolled and attending for FDOP. These new students were not enrolled and attending for two consecutive FDOPs because they enrolled after the first FDOP but would be considered as persisting.\n\nPersistence data can be found in a few different places. Official persistence data is stored in the Data Warehouse in the Fact.PersistenceCode and Fact.PersistenceCodeHistorical tables. These include clear indicators of whether a student is considered to be a Leaver, a student leaving before FDOP. However, at the beginning of the school year, when we are likely to update the persistence metrics for the Growth Scorecards, the current school years’ persistence data may not yet be in the PersistenceCode table. In Fall of 2025, we had to estimate persistence for the current academic year using attendance data.\nAccording to the RAP Manual, there are two possible formulas for calculating persistence (IDEA RAP Team, n.d.), which provide slightly different estimates of persistence:\n\\[\n1)\\text{ } \\% \\text{ Persistence} = \\left(1-\\frac{\\# \\text{ Leavers}}{\\text{Total } \\# \\text{ of Students}}\\right)*100\n\\]\n\\[\n2)\\text{ } \\% \\text{ Persistence} = \\left(1-\\frac{\\# \\text{ FDOPLeavers}}{(\\# \\text{ FDOP Enrolled}) + (\\# \\text{ of FDOP New Entries})}\\right)*100\n\\]\nFor the Fall 2025 Growth Scorecards tracking persistence from 2023-2024 to 2024-2025, we used Equation 1.\nAs stated above, when current data is not available from a persistence table, we must estimate student persistence using attendance data. This estimate is imperfect and does not account for students who enrolled after FDOP in year 1 (New Entries). Therefore, student persistence calculated from the persistence tables are not directly comparable to student persistence estimated from attendance data.\n\\[\n\\text{ } \\% \\text{ Persistence} = \\left(1 - \\frac{(\\# \\text{ Absent FDOP Year 2)} + (\\#\\text{ Not Enrolled on FDOP Year 2)}}{\\# \\text{ Present on FDOP Year 1}}\\right)*100\n\\]\n\n6.3.1 Notes & Exclusions\n\nAcross all options for persistence calculations, students enrolled in 12th grade in Year 1 who do not return for Year 2 are excluded from the calculations (from both the numerator and denominator).\nTwo IDEA schools, Travis Academy and A. W. Brown Academy, currently have PreK classes and enrollment goals. We have excluded PreK students and enrollment goals from this metric.\nPersistence calculated from the official persistence tables is calculated differently than estimates calculated from attendance data. The later does not account for students who enrolled after FDOP in year 1 (New Entries). Therefore, student persistence calculated from the persistence tables are not directly comparable to student persistence estimated from attendance data.\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Source\nAs described above, there are multiple different sources and calculation possibilities for student persistence. Ideally, we would use calculations from the official persistence tables (current or historical), but persistence tables are not always current at the beginning of the school year.\nFor the Fall 2025 scorecard, we used estimates from the attendance data. The code does, however, also pull the previous year’s official persistence data and create a tab in the Excel output workbook with the relevant data.\nLike with enrollment data, the attendance data includes a row for each day for each student. We take a similar approach as describe in Section 6.1 with creating a long filter to more efficiently pull the data.\n\n# Using attendence on FDOP\nattend_conn &lt;- get_table(.table_name = \"Students\",\n                         .schema = \"Attendance\",\n                         .database_name = \"PROD1\",\n                         .server_name = \"RGVPDSD-DWPRD1\")\n\n## Pull data for FDOP\nattend_fdop &lt;- attend_conn %&gt;%\n  select(AcademicYear,\n         schoolnumber,\n         StateSchoolNumber,\n         SchoolShortName,\n         SchoolType,\n         RegionDescription,\n         GradeLevelID,\n         AttStudentKey,\n         StudentNumber,\n         WeekNumber,\n         DateNumber,\n         AttDate,\n         Membership,\n         Absences,\n         ContinuouslyEnrolled,\n         PersistenceType,\n         Enroll) %&gt;%\n  filter(schoolnumber == 137 & AttDate == '2024-08-22'|\n         schoolnumber == 108807123 & AttDate == '2024-08-27'|\n         schoolnumber == 108807185 & AttDate == '2024-08-19'|\n         # ..\n         schoolnumber == 108807103 & AttDate == '2025-08-28'\n        ) %&gt;%\n  collect()\n\n\n\n\n\nIDEA Public Schools. 2024. “2024 Enrollment Targets.” https://ideapublicschoolsorg.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/EnrollmentTeam/EQYrtn-kqAlErstmV-Ek24MBRso_0VwOFMXHK1FIoPtAiA?e=aByUb6.\n\n\n———. 2025. “2025 Enrollment Targets.” https://ideapublicschoolsorg.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/EnrollmentTeam/ESFRiuKetQVNgRfRsOyAwhgBbGsH09Gjy9H_2l02tyYB4g?e=3Koj1M.\n\n\nIDEA Public Schools Data Warehouse. 2025. “Enrollment.”\n\n\nIDEA RAP Team. n.d.
